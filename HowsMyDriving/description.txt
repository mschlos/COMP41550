Original proposal email :)

##########################################################################################

Hi Genome!
Please consider this email my proposal for my Mobile Applications Development app.

I am proposing to develop an app that will use the device accelerometer to rate the driving behaviour of the user. 
(This is sort of a research topic for my company)

The app will be called "Rate My Driving" or "How's My Driving".

My idea is that when the user is in the car, and opens the app and clicks a "Start Journey" the accelerometer will measure g-forces and accelerometer statistics to rate the drivers journey. 

The app will log sudden changes in g-foces and give the driver a rating out of 10 for their journey, perhaps with some advise on breaking or cornering and some fun slogans like 
"Driving Miss Daisy was your favourite film!" or
"You are more careful than my grandmother!" or 
"Stop trying to corner like a house fly!" or
"You drive like you stole the car!" or
"You break like Michael Schumacher!" or
"You are not playing Grand Theft Auto!" etc 

I hope to implement about 3 screens
- Welcome - Start Journey
- Journey in Progress (maybe showing live exceptions and warnings)
- Results Screen (showing results and final ratings) 

Should the app be a success, a "nice to have" in the app would be to implement the sharing of results of the app on social media sites like FaceBook and Twitter, as a form of promotion:
"I just scored 6/10 on the Rate My Driving app, can you do better (or worse)? - get the free app here <app store link>"

Another "nice to have" would be to use the location and GPS hardware to measure speed and distance and show those diagnostics either live or in the results. 

I chose this idea as it would be a help to me to gain the knowledge for future app developments for my company. 
Is this app idea Ok?

Kindest Regards,

Since I wrote the above proposal I was hoping to implement a few more things:
- Setup iSimulator with my iPad / iPhone to simulate the changes in accelerometer
- Log exceptions in driver behaviour (e.g. when x,y or z value raises above a threshold)
- Calculate a scow out of 10 based on the results etc
