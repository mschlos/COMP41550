Start logging the results, get the highest g-forces etc
if g-force goes above x then log x with a time (and eventually position)


Create and algorithm to calculate a score out of 10 based on the g-forces (and eventually distance)

When Stop Journey is pressed show the results.
Give a random funny comment for the score (with crowd applause or crowd sigh)
"You couldn't steer your way out of a paper bag"
"You couldn't drive a nail through a bag of water"

Allow user to share the results on Twitter, Facebook.

Update the UI significantly to make it look more professional
